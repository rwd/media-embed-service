### First

### Start development server with:

`yarn start:dev` or `npm run start:dev`

Default port has been set to 9001.
It's possible to use a different port by specifying this first like so: 

`EMVE_PORT=2345 yarn start:dev` to start with port 2345. Same for npm just include `EMVE_PORT=2345` at the beginning.
